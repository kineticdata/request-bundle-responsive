# Setup

## Overview

Setup contains resources that can be leveraged for catalog and portal development using Kinetic Request Bundles. 

####The following setup directories are contained within this Bundle:

kurl
:   Contains the [Kurl](http://community.kineticdata.com/10_Kinetic_Request/KURL/) configuration files for setting up the portal pages for this Bundle.

npm

For example, building a JavaScript distribution for **bundle/common** or minifying different UI code formats like CSS, JavaScript and HTML.

sass
:   Contains [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)  configuration files, which can be used to manage CSS distributions for common.
